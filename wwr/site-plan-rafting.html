      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Here in Cool Rapids our main purpose is to get fun to families and
        people that likes intensive adventures, but to also have something for
        the not so adventurous. In order to accomplish this, we want to show our
        customers that whitewater rafting can be a lot of fun, but most
        importantly safe. We would love to show our future clients what we can
        offer as a first option for vacations, retreats and many more
        activities. With help of this site we will help you understand that
        safty is our first and last thing to do aswell as the different
        experience levels of each adventure.
      </p>
